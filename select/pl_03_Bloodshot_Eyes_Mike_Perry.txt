I know a place under the sun
Where my memories of you
will burn
You'll be too easy to forget
Erased by the light,
you'll never cast a shadow
A ghost on the wind,
it's like I never knew you
I burnt that bridge
down to the ground
I'm on the other side
I'd say it's all your fault
but we know that's not true
Still, I don't care enough to
make it up to you
Bloodshot eyes and wasted time
You're everything I left behind
I won't reconcile,
you've lost your mind
I'm leaving you behind
Bloodshot
A sad cliché of love and hate
Deserving everything we get
Not worth a moment of regret
I open my eyes
and see the dream is long dead
I turned my back
and quit the war in my head
I left our Eden dead
and to the weeds
So tired of wasting time
I'd say there's still a chance
but we know that's not true
I'm never coming back to suffer
there with you
Bloodshot eyes and wasted time
You're everything I left behind
I won't reconcile,
you've lost your mind
I'm leaving you behind
Bloodshot
(Bloodshot eyes)
I don't give a fuck
what you have to say
I cut my losses
and I walked away
I don't give a fuck about
what you have to say
You don't matter at all
You're nothing to me
Bloodshot eyes and wasted time
You're everything I left behind
I won't reconcile,
you've lost your mind
I'm leaving you behind
Bloodshot eyes
I'd say it's all your fault
but we know that's not true
I don't give a fuck about
what you have to say
Bloodshot eyes
Still, I don't care enough to
make it up to you
Bloodshot
