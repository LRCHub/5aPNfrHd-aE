Hey, what you doin' to me, babe?
I'm really feelin' your swag
You got me twisted like that
Now, I'm smoking on your vibes
Got me straight
hittin' the floor
But got me flyin' so high
You're so sweet
(you're so sweet)
to me
(to me)
You're my sticky-icky-icky-icky
Put me fast to sleep
(put me fast to sleep)
You're so sweet
(you're so sweet)
to me (to me)
You got me higher, higher,
higher than I've been
Don't ever leave
(don't ever leave)
What you doin' to me?
While you watch,
I'll put on a show
Sit, let's flip the role
I'll have you losing control
I'll grind you down
and light you up
Next thing you know,
won't know what's up
That's how it goes
Got that? Good,
now watch it grow, ooh
You're so sweet
(you're so sweet)
to me
(to me)
You're my sticky-icky-icky-icky
Put me fast to sleep
(put me fast to sleep)
You're so sweet
(you're so sweet)
to me (to me)
You got me higher, higher,
higher than I've been
Don't ever leave
(don't ever leave)
What you doin' to me?
(Don't ever leave)
What you doin' to me?
(Don't ever leave)
What you doin' to me?
(Don't ever leave)
What you doin' to me?
(Don't ever leave)
What you doin' to me?
