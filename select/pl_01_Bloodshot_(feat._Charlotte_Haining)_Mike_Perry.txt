Am I smoking too much
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no
That's not why I'm still red
I never wanted your love
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no
Why you clogging up my head?
How did I go from loving you
To hugging my pillow instead
I didn't notice all of the space
Till you were outta my bed
I didn't want this, none of it
Pretty sure
that's what I said to you
And now baby look what you do
I got these bloodshot eyes
Over countless sleepless nights
I've been thinking of you
(I've been thinking of)
I've been thinking of you
(I've been thinking of)
I got these bloodshot eyes
Oh I said I wouldn't cry
Cry over you
(I've been crying over)
Cry over you
I got these bloodshot eyes
Over countless sleepless nights
I've been thinking of you
(I've been thinking of)
I've been thinking of you
(I've been thinking of)
I got these bloodshot eyes
Oh I said I wouldn't cry
Cry over you
(I've been crying over)
Cry over you
(I've been crying)
Too much caffeine in my blood
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no
That's not what's keeping me up
(Oh no, oh no)
I never needed your touch
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no
So how can I miss it this much
How did I go from loving you
To hugging my pillow instead
I didn't notice all of the space
Till you were outta my bed
I didn't want this, none of it
Pretty sure
that's what I said to you
And now baby look what you do
I got these bloodshot eyes
Over countless sleepless nights
I've been thinking of you
(I've been thinking of)
I've been thinking of you
(I've been thinking of)
I got these bloodshot eyes
Oh I said I wouldn't cry
Cry over you
(I've been crying over)
Cry over you
I got these bloodshot eyes
Over countless sleepless nights
I've been thinking of you
(I've been thinking of)
I've been thinking of you
(I've been thinking of)
I got these bloodshot eyes
Oh I said I wouldn't cry
Cry over you
(I've been crying over)
Cry over you
(I've been crying)
Tears are rolling
I can't control it
I never wanted to
Cry over you
Cry over you
Tears are rolling
I can't control it
I never wanted to
Cry over you
Cry over you, yeah
I got these bloodshot eyes
Over countless sleepless nights
I've been thinking of you
(I've been thinking of)
I've been thinking of you
(I've been thinking of)
I got these bloodshot eyes
Oh I said I wouldn't cry
Cry over you
(I've been crying over)
Cry over you
(I've been crying over you)
Tears are rolling
I can't control it
I never wanted to
(Cry over you)
cry over you
(Cry over you)
cry over you
Tears are rolling
I can't control it
I never wanted to
(Cry over you)
cry over you
(Cry over you)
cry over you
