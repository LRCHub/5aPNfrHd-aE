I can see myself inside
Your bloodshot eyes
Wondering if you can see
yourself in mine
Or do you just see me
And of me what you want to see?
Middle of the night
All I can see are stars;
Pulled 'em from my eyes
And your ex-lover's arms
Throw hook after hook
And if I were you
After all that I did
I'd have done it to me, too
Isn't like I did it on purpose
I just forget the second
I learned it
Everything I get I deserve
You whisper to me
"Don't you like it
when it hurts"?
Five days out
From the initial event
It takes two kinds of pills
To uncleanch my fists
It's too kind of you
To say you can help
But there's no one around
Who can save me from myself
Isn't like I do this on purpose
I just forget the second
I've learned it
Looking for Little Oblivions
I'd do anything knowing
you would forgive me
Oh
There is no glory in love
Only the gore of our hearts
Oh
Let it come for my throat
Take me and tear me apart
Ooh, there is no glory in love
Only the gore of our hearts
Ooh, let it come for my throat
Take me and tear me apart
Drag me away in the dark
Take me and tear me apart
