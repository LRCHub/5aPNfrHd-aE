You stop believing!

With bloodshot eyes you see right through me
So paranoid, I trapped you in my lies
Remember when you laid in my arms and pleaded
For just another chance now it's my fault
It's my fault, I'm pleading

Bury me before my heart stops beating
Close your eyes and tell me why this is breaking
My whole heart is torn into pieces
Just because you stopped believing!

We're out of time, there's no excuses
I take the blame, it won't just fade away
Until my last breath and I am lying with you
I will wear this burden in my heart, my heart
I'll keep you

Bury me before my heart stops beating
Close your eyes and tell me why this is breaking
My whole heart is torn into pieces
Just because you stopped believing!

You spread your lies
My back's against the wall
Screaming out
You've got me where you want me

You spread your lies
My back's against the wall
Screaming out
You've got me where you want me, where you want me!

Bury me before my heart stops beating
Close your eyes and tell me why this is breaking
My whole heart is torn into pieces
Just because you stopped believing
