Running on no sleep, shell shocked.
This love has love has got grid-locked,
Look into my eyes, I'm runnin' straight bloodshot.

Devoted patriot, I've been up all night long.
Some may find it somewhat wrong,
But now what else you got?

Should I lay my head to rest waiting for another day?
Should I stop to smell the roses like the wisemen say?

This drive inside of me is killing me
And I deserve it.
I feel myself fading
And I'm still convinced it's worth it.

I'm runnin' it bloodshot fanatical.
Can't take time for sabatical.
Won't make this mathematical.
I'm running straight bloodshot.

Yes, you best believe it's mandatory for the test.
I'm makin' all my time invest, and won't be settlin' for less.
Nah, you won't be catchin' me off gaurd.
I'm playin' it die-hard even if it's making no sense.

Time stands still, I know that next hour's creeping.
I'm at it always. Never stopin', never sleepin'.
Finally, yes I found somethin' I can give my life to.
I don't think I could ever stop, even if I'd like to.

I'm runnin' it bloodshot fanatical.
Can't take time for sabatical.
Won't make this mathematical.
I'm running straight bloodshot.

(Unable to understand) bloodshot fanatical.
(Unable to understand) bloodshot fanatical.

No sleep shell shock
(Unable to understand)
But I'll give what I've got,
I'm running straight bloodshot.
