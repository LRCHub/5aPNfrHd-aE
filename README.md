[00:17.04] I know a place under the sun
[00:21.05] Where my memories of you will burn
[00:26.27] You'll be too easy to forget
[00:33.47] Erased by the light, you'll never cast a shadow
[00:37.54] A ghost on the wind, it's like I never knew you
[00:42.67] I burnt that bridge down to the ground
[00:47.47] I'm on the other side
[00:57.97] 
[00:51.18] I'd say it's all your fault but we know that's not true
[00:58.23] Still, I don't care enough to make it up to you
[01:21.73] 
[01:02.83] Bloodshot eyes and wasted time
[01:06.58] You're everything I left behind
[01:10.56] I won't reconcile, you've lost your mind
[01:14.82] I'm leaving you behind
[01:18.08] Bloodshot
[01:22.58] 
[01:23.12] A sad cliché of love and hate
[01:27.16] Deserving everything we get
[01:32.00] Not worth a moment of regret
[01:39.57] I open my eyes and see the dream is long dead
[01:43.83] I turned my back and quit the war in my head
[01:48.16] I left our Eden dead and to the weeds
[01:53.66] So tired of wasting time
[02:05.66] 
[01:57.31] I'd say there's still a chance but we know that's not true
[02:04.39] I'm never coming back to suffer there with you
[02:27.39] 
[02:09.13] Bloodshot eyes and wasted time
[02:12.92] You're everything I left behind
[02:16.67] I won't reconcile, you've lost your mind
[02:21.22] I'm leaving you behind
[02:24.33] Bloodshot
[02:28.83] 
[02:32.84] (Bloodshot eyes)
[02:40.84] 
[02:42.14] I don't give a fuck what you have to say
[02:46.09] I cut my losses and I walked away
[02:50.49] I don't give a fuck about what you have to say
[02:54.19] You don't matter at all
[02:57.36] You're nothing to me
[03:07.36] 
[03:02.76] Bloodshot eyes and wasted time
[03:06.63] You're everything I left behind
[03:10.54] I won't reconcile, you've lost your mind
[03:15.14] I'm leaving you behind
[03:18.32] Bloodshot eyes
[03:25.32] 
[03:20.17] I'd say it's all your fault but we know that's not true
[03:23.48] I don't give a fuck about what you have to say
[03:26.60] Bloodshot eyes
[03:28.34] Still, I don't care enough to make it up to you, to you
[03:34.60] Bloodshot
